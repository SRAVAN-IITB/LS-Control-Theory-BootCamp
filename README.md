# Control Theory Bootcamp
You are at my repository on the course of **Control Theory Bootcamp** offered by Electronics and Robotics Club under the Technical Summer School (TSS) of 7th Edition of Learners' Space (2023), 
an initiative by the Institute Technical Council (ITC) in collaboration with the Career Cell of Undergraduate Academic Council (UGAC) at ***IIT Bombay***.

## Description
The course aims to familiarize students with Controls Theory using PID and the self balancing bot as examples, and also introduce them to relevant software like MATLAB and Simulink library for Python. 
The course will also cover basics of Neural Networks and its applications in PID control as well as an introduction to swarm robotics.
The course will provide relevant learning resources, projects, assignments, and doubt-clearing sessions.

## Timeline
### Week-1
- Introduction to **mathematical modeling of dynamic systems**.
### Week-2
- **Control Theory and mathematical construct**, using PID as an example.
- Introduction to **PID tuning using neural networks**, very basic Python, and 
simulating a **PID-based ball-balancer** using stub code provided using the pygame library.
### Week-3
- Introduction to **MATLAB** and **Simulink**, with a focus on the key functions required for implementing a control system. 
- Introduction to the problem statement of an **inverted pendulum**. 
- Learning how to model your **robot** in Simulink.
### Week-4
- Introduction to **swarm robotics**.
- Designing **algorithms for swarm robotics**.
